Specify how each level of data should be treated:\n   - Public data can be shared externally\n   - Internal data must remain within the company\n   - Confidential data requires special handling and encryption\n\nThe policy also mandates that all new data must be classified within 24 hours of creation, ensuring proper data management and security from the outset.

LLM Usage:\n- Requires IT Security team approval within 48 hours of request\n\nWhile not directly stated, it's reasonable to infer that LLM usage would need to follow the data classification policies when processing different types of company data, especially considering the sensitivity levels and handling requirements for different data classifications.\n\nThe document appears to treat these as separate but important compliance areas within the overall AI usage framework.",
